# BFS_Maze

# Overview

A Python-based maze-solving program using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in a grid-based maze. The agent's movement is animated step-by-step in the console.

# Features

Grid-based Maze: Walls ('X') and open paths (' ').

BFS Algorithm: Finds the shortest path.

Console Animation: Visualizes the solution.


# How It Works:

The Maze class manages the maze structure.

The Agent class implements BFS.

main initializes and animates the solution.
